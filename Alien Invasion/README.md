# Alien Invasion





![Screenshot](/screenshot.png)





This is an Alien Invasion game built in Pygame. Use alien_invasion.py to launch the game - but make sure you have Pygame installed first!



```
pip install pygame
```



As you progress through levels, the game gets faster - the aliens travel downwards faster and the ship and bullets travel faster as well. The game also has functionality for counting high score. You can tweak the game by exploring through settings.py and having fun with the settings!



Note: This game was made as part of me completing the amazing book [Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes](https://nostarch.com/pythoncrashcourse2e)!





## Controls



Use arrow keys to move the ship, and spacebar to shoot. Pressing Q quits the game. 





## Future plans



- Write high score to a file to keep it permanent
- Refactor and optimize code
- Make aliens shoot beams as well
- Add shield powerup after a specific score
- Add sound effects
