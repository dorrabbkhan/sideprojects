![Weather App Demo](capture.gif)







GUI weather app made in Tkinter that uses requests to connect to Openweathermap API, parse JSON information and instantly display weather information for a given city. Run weatherapp.py to run the app, enter the city and click 'Get weather' to show weather!



Note: This script depends on requests, so make sure you have it installed using:



```
pip install requests
```
